The course will first provide an in depth foundation on the function of neurons including the cell biology of neurons, the neuronal membrane, the action potential, nerve cell communication, and the structure and function of synapses. Having established this basic understanding of nervous system function, we will then study a selection of other topics in detail. A major focus will be how the visual system uses information about light, dark, and color received at the retina, and through multiple levels of processing in the cortex produces our perception of the visual field. Other topics may include synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s.',
