This course, then, looks most closely at operational military history. Far from taking only a \'bullets and bayonets\' view of the American military past, we will also employ the \'new military history\' to examine the effect on operations of policy (ends) and strategy (ways), the human experience in battle (face of battle), increasingly complex technology (means), and geography (fields of battle).
